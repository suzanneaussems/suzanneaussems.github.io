<b>Schools</b>

<p style="font-size:18px">
<b>Mrs. Rachel Gillett</b>
</p>
<p>“I am the Executive Headteacher of Kenilworth and Whitnash Nursery
Schools, Co-lead of Warwickshire Teaching School Alliance and a National
Leader of Education. Our Schools are innovative and active research is a
key part of our work in developing appropriate experiences to fulfil our
vision of effective early childhood education. We have been fortunate to
work with Dr Suzanne Aussems, of the Department of Psychology at the
University of Warwick on a number of occasions to support her research
and extend our thinking.</p>
<p>Suzanne is extremely professional in her approach and thoughtful in
her research choices. She provides clear ethical frameworks and
communicates efficiently and accurately. Suzanne has completed research
in both Schools, communicating with myself, my staff teams and the
parents of the children involved to ensure the process is very well
organised and understood. The children who participate enjoy their
involvement because her research is well designed and implemented. As a
result of her work staff have considered how language is offered and the
value of intonation and expressiveness in addition to the gesticulation
or body movements we may link to words and stories.</p>
<p>We very much hope to continue to link with Suzanne in any future
research and are confident to endorse her professional approach and
thoughtful, meaningful research.”</p>
<p style="font-size:24px">
<b>Students</b>
</p>
<p style="font-size:18px">
<b>Ms. Charlotte Devey-Smith</b>
</p>
<p>“I am an Assistant Psychologist working in a school in East London. I
provide interventions for students, train staff members on areas of
psychology such as Anxiety and Working Memory, and follow the direction
and supervision of an Educational Psychologist. I had the pleasure of
meeting Suzanne during my Undergraduate Degree at the University of
Warwick. Here, she co-supervised my dissertation and supported me on a
funded student placement scheme (URSS: Undergraduate Research Support
Scheme).</p>
<p>My dissertation investigated sound symbolism and iconic gesture. The
research question was “Can iconic pitch cues help 14-17-month-old
infants understand iconic gestures?”. I further explored this, with the
help of Suzanne, in a URSS project. I thoroughly enjoyed working
alongside Suzanne and gaining insight into the world of academic
research.</p>
<p>I would be more than happy to recommend Suzanne as a supervisor for
future dissertation projects/placements students. She is not only
professional and articulate but can also explain difficult concepts in
easy to understand ways. She does so with kindness and sensitivity and
is a fountain of knowledge. She will go the extra mile to help you and
make sure you develop to the best of your abilities.</p>
<p>I hope to continue working with Suzanne as I develop my career, and
publish research together in the future!”</p>
<p style="font-size:18px">
<b>Ms. Rebecca Morris</b>
</p>
<p>“I have worked with Suzanne as a summer placement student in 2022. My
main task involved upkeep of the family database used to securely store
child participant information, by contacting parents to update
information and removing participants from the database who were not
able to be contacted or had requested to be removed. I also worked on
recruitment of new participants using social media, such as Facebook,
and added these new sign-ups to the database. Over the placement, I was
taught how to code infant vocalisations using the software ELAN. Suzanne
also taught me new ways to use SPSS, such as for calculating inter-rater
reliability. I also met with a PhD student to voice record stimuli to be
used in their research project.</p>
<p>Suzanne has been extremely welcoming and engaging throughout the
placement and has helped me to gain new skills that will be useful
throughout my further education and future jobs. She is evidently
passionate about the research area and learning from Suzanne has been
thoroughly enjoyable. I am very grateful to have been given this summer
placement and appreciate all that Suzanne has helped me with. It has
been a privilege to spend my summer on this placement, before continuing
with my studies.”</p>
<p style="font-size:24px">
<b>Research Assistants</b>
</p>
<p style="font-size:18px">
<b>Ms. Lucy Martin</b>
</p>
<p>“I am a Research Assistant working on the Baby Books development
research project at Royal Holloway, University of London. Here I had the
privilege of working under the guidance of Suzanne, who had assumed the
postdoctoral role on the project and therefore supervised my first role
in research. The research investigated language development of
1-year-old babies in relation to picture books and shared book reading
with caregivers. The main focus surrounds whether infants learn new
words from educational picture books, and if the different properties of
educational picture books would benefit language acquisition. The
insight and knowledge that Suzanne provided me into this new world of
research was invaluable, and I am lucky to have worked with her during
my first role in research.</p>
<p>I cannot recommend Suzanne highly enough, not only does she
demonstrate extreme professionalism, but is an incredible mentor through
her ways of communicating with colleagues of all roles. She is
compassionate and kind, whilst maintaining an easy-to-understand
approach to difficult concepts. Her quality of work is impeccable, and
she really took care to aid my personal development also. I very much
hope to remain in contact with Suzanne and I wish to have the privilege
to work alongside her again as I continue my studies and look to develop
my career.”</p>
